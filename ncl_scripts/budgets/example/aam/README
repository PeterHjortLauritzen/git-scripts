Axial Angular Momentum (AAM) Diagnostics
========================================

To plot a time-series of AAM 

1. go to your run directory
2. assuming that your history files are in *.h2.*.nc execute

	source ~/git-scripts/ncl_scripts/budgets/aam_budgets.sh case_name.h2 i

  This will produce a file "dmdt.nc" with the AAM time-series on them

3. Produce plot

   ncl < ~/git-scripts/ncl_scripts/budgets/aam_plot.ncl

   The plot file is named aam_plot.pdf

The fincl for AAM diagnostics is:

fincl3         = 'MR_dED', 'MO_dED', 'MR_dAF', 'MO_dAF', 'MR_dBD', 'MO_dBD', 'MR_dAD', 'MO_dAD', 'MR_dAR', 'MO_dAR', 'MR_dBF',
                 'MO_dBF', 'MR_dBH', 'MO_dBH', 'MR_dCH', 'MO_dCH', 'MR_dAH', 'MO_dAH'
nhtfrq         = -24
ndens          = 1
